# coreos-iso-maker V2.8
Update this version:  PPC64 support!  This requires a new variable detailed below

Updates this version:  My thanks to Loic Mulder (https://github.com/lmulder) for the following tweaks and additions:
* ISO won't be redownloaded if it is already present on the system.
* inventory file now uses group single group names.  This aligns with the ignition file generated by the openshift-installer

# coreos-iso-maker V2.6

Many thanks to Stephen Nimmo (https://github.com/snimmo-redhat) for a Pull Request that now adds support
for FULL X.Y.Z releases.  This feature should allow you to specify whatever version of the CoreOS image
you want (EXCEPT 4.2 due to some weird naming changes but that is about to go EOL anyway.) 

# coreos-iso-maker V2.5
New feature!  coreos-iso-maker now supports 2 NIC installs.  More should be possible but you are on your own for 
adding that.  :-)  Just follow the examples. *N.B.* The _may_ be an issue with the hostname being the same for
both network interfaces.  If anyone notices an issue, please speak up!

New in V2.4.3
Thanks to https://github.com/christianh814 for a PR that now includes an `install_drive` parameter to deal with
cases where the default install drive is something other than `sda` (like `vda` found in libvirt).  Also note
that coreos-iso-maker has support for tags if you need older versions.  Current tags are v4.2 and v4.3.  Support
for v4.4 and later is on the horizon once I get some cycles.  This version also ensures `rsync` is installed for
the minimalists out there.

New in V2.4.2
New feature:  The MULTI ISO maker now has a 10 second timeout before it autoboots the installer.  This feature
does NOT work on the SINGLE ISO version because of the risks associated with having it IP clashes.  Thanks to
Victor Sira for nudging me to add this

New in V2.4.1
Bug fixes and updated output to call the ignition files named based on the group.  E.g. The `[masters]` group creates
a `masters.ign` file to boot from, `[bootstrap]` uses the `bootstrap.ign` file.

New in  coreos-iso-maker V2.4
This version:  The `dns` variable in `group_vars/all.yml` is now a list.  Because of the way DNS works
do NOT specify more than 3 servers for this.  Thanks to Scott Worthington (https://github.com/worsco) for pointers
on how to do this.

New in Version 2.3
This version incorporates the ability to generate either a single ISO for OCP 4.x
installations or multiple ISOs depending on needs.  These ISOs are created for
when you need statis IPs.

New from version 2.2:  Make sure that genisoimage package is installed.
Special thanks to Scott Worthington (https://github.com/worsco)
for this Pull Request.

New in version 2.3: Enable UEFI booting by also adjusting the grub.cfg.  This
also fixed a long standing and unnoticed bug in previous version.  Special thanks
to ahmbas (https://github.com/ahmbas) for helping me find this bug and making me learn
more about ISOLINUX vs. UEFI booting.
